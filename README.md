<h3><b>Musical Instrument Identification</b> - CS 229 Project</h3>
This is my final project for Stanford's Machine Learning class. It is a musical instrument classifier that uses MFCCs and warped LPC coefficients as features. Classifiers used are a simple logistic regression
model and an SVM. I was able to get an accuracy of 100% with a small dataset. The models have been trained on the Bach10 dataset that only contanins violin, clarinet, saxophone and bassoon excerpts.
